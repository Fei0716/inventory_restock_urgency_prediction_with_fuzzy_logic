# üß† Inventory Restock Urgency Prediction with Fuzzy Logic

This project uses **Fuzzy Logic** to determine the urgency of restocking inventory based on real-world parameters such as sales, stock level, lead time, and price.

## üß† FIS (Fuzzy Inference System) Details

### üîç Membership Function Construction

- Membership functions were built using a **data-driven approach** via **Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)** clustering.
- The **cluster centers** identified by FCM were used to construct:
  - **Left and right shoulder (trapezoidal)** membership functions for extreme cases (e.g., very low or very high values).
  - **Triangular** membership functions for intermediate categories.
- The FCM clustering was applied to **three months** of inventory data extracted from the file:
### üìè Rule Construction

- Fuzzy rules were crafted based on **expert knowledge and experience**, rather than automated rule generation.
- This approach was necessary because the dataset does **not include labeled restock urgency**, making it impossible to directly learn rules from the data.

### ‚ùì Why Use FCM + Expert Rules?

- **No labels available** for restock urgency ‚Üí supervised learning approaches are not feasible.
- FCM provides **data-driven ranges** for fuzzy sets (e.g., Low, Medium, High), ensuring the system adapts to the actual distribution of values in the dataset.
- Expert rules ensure that the logic behind restock decisions reflects **real-world operational knowledge**.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Why Not Use Expert-Defined Ranges for Membership Functions?

- Predefined numeric ranges from experts might **not generalize well** to inventory data sourced from different companies or domains.
- The meaning of "Low stock" or "High price" can **vary significantly** depending on the dataset context.
- Using FCM ensures that membership functions are aligned with the **actual data distribution**, increasing the model's robustness and flexibility.
